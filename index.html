  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>
    The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is the world's dominant software platform.[1] It was originally a hypertext document
    management system[2] accessed over the Internet.The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be
    accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.
    Web resources may be any type of downloaded media, but web pages are hypertext documents formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
    Special HTML syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs, which permits users to navigate to other web resources. In addition to text,
    web pages may contain references to images, video, audio, and software components, which are either displayed or internally executed in the
    user's web browser to render pages or streams of multimedia content. Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain
    name make up a website. Websites are stored in computers that are running a web server, which is a program that responds to requests made
    over the Internet from web browsers running on a user's computer. Website content can be provided by a publisher or interactively from
    user-generated content. Websites are provided for a myriad of informative, entertainment, commercial, and governmental reasons.

  <p style="margin-top:45px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
